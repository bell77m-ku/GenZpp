<Computer Architechture Project>


GenZ++ is an interpreted esoteric computer language based on Python written by us, 4 broke college students.
this project was made for amusement and entertainment value.


To start using GenZ++, follow these steps:
- 1.Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/bell77m-ku/RudeLang
- 2.Click on the "Download ZIP" option.
- 3.Once the download is complete, locate the zip file in your downloads folder or the location you specified for downloads.
- 4.Extract the contents of the zip file to access the files and folders within the repository.



How to use GenZ++
- 1.Write code in a new file with extension .gzpp
- 2.Select a file name Main_character.py then run this file (A computer trying to execute GenZ++ scripts required python 3 in order to execute “Main_character.py” file)
- 3.In the terminal, call the run() function. To run the code.gzpp by run("filename.gzpp")

   

GenZ++, like any other computer languages, can be used for basic and complex arithmetic albeit with “Gen Z” languages for syntax.

- No data types specification, they’re all a lil bitch
- Extensive functions that doesn’t do anything bruh
- Instead of true and false it’s all W or L
- No boomer zone. OK boomer.

 This is comparison of ' Python language(Left side) ' and 'GenZ++(right side)' .

VAR            -  BITCH   
FUN            -  JOB   
END            -  PUT_IN_2_WEEKS   
FOR            -  SIDE_HUSTLE   
WHILE          -  CORPORATE_JOB   
TRUE           -  W   
FALSE          -  L   
CONTINUE       -  BET   
BREAK          -  CRINGE   
NOTHING        -  BRUH   
INDEX()        -  TFW   
PRINT()        -  CRITICIZE   
'NOT OPERATOR' -  SUS   
ELSE           -  OTHERWISE     
ELIF           -  OTHERWISE_IF   
RANDOM()       -  GACHA
