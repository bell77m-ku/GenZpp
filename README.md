<Computer Architechture Project>
GenZ++

GenZ++ is an interpreted esoteric computer language based on Python written by us, 4 broke college students.
this project was made for amusement and entertainment value.


To start using GenZ++, follow these steps:
- 1)Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/bell77m-ku/RudeLang
- 2) click on the "Download ZIP" option.
- 3) Once the download is complete, locate the zip file in your downloads folder or the location you specified for downloads.
- 4) Extract the contents of the zip file to access the files and folders within the repository.



How to use GenZ++
- 1. Write code in a new file with extension genz++.
- 2. select a file name Main_character.py then run this file (A computer trying to execute GenZ++ scripts required python 3 in order to execute “Main_character.py” file)
- 3. In the terminal, call the run() function. To run the code.gzpp by run("filename.gzpp")

   

GenZ++, like any other computer languages, can be used for basic and complex arithmetic albeit with “Gen Z” languages for syntax.

- No data types specification, they’re all a lil bitch
- Extensive functions that doesn’t do anything bruh
- Instead of true and false it’s all W or L
- No boomer zone. OK boomer.
